## AWS Sagemake Deployment

* Setting up your machine.
* For the instance we suggest, ml.p2.xlarge, is $1.26 an hour
  * Has the Nvidia K80 GPU and 50 GB of EBS disk space.   
* We will use AWS CloudFormation to provision all of the SageMaker resources including the Notebook instance
* ->    EXPENSIVE FOR P2 type and damn slow.
* moving to crestle gcloud based.
