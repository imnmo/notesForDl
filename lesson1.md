Lesson one notes:

* Contains 7 lessons and we tend to expect about 10 hours of homework
* So totally expect about in 70 hours of work in total 
* From my analysis its going to take about 5 hour per lecture plus 10 hour for the homework, so in total 
roughly 15 hrs pro week
*  IF you follow this 15 hour model and at the end you ll build up the Image clasification at the world class 
level/classify the text/supermarket prices/Netflix predictions etc and worldclass problems
* Leave about the Naysayers, its doesnt need lot of learning and so on

ADVICES:
--------
--------

* You ll able to build the things much more faster than understanding in  the thoery and 
Remember, you will learn "How it works before you learn why it works"
* Get experience to get our hands on and know how to work with the code and
how to work with the data 
	* The best way to create models is to do lot of models and do lots of 
	CODING and STUDY them CAREFULLY

CODING:
------
* Do the shift + Enter for the coding part
* three lines are special directives to the JP notebooks so called code magics 
* load the library for the fast ai and fast ai sits on top of the Pytorch and one of the ways is that 
pytorch is modern than the tensorflow and things can be done lot more quickly
* Fast ai + Pytorch
* Fast ai 
	* vision
	* NLP
	* tabular data
	* Collabotating filtering
* Never do the import * because of the production issues(but the Data scientist way is bit different)
