# Data cleaning and production:
-----------------------
* Share your ideas because by sharing you are able to really get good the mistakes you
are doing. 
* A guy about the WhatsApp clean up between meme/photos and images
* Spectrum sound classificiation, where we are able to get about 80% of the
results using classificiation -> turning sound into pictures
* State of the art accuracy for DCHD Suvash Thapliya 99.02% 
* Alena Harley 
* Simon Wilison and natalie downe
* james Delinger bird classificiation
* Daniel Armstrong who has no idea tried to open a PR 
* zuchinni vs cucumber classifier
* Discovering the country by looking at the aerial view. 
* So don't worry if you haven't had or got a project, some of them
had already got a head start and they do it well while others don'the
* We dig into Dig deeper on CV application. 



ADVICES:
--------
* code first -> you just able to run the code and get something hapeening
and experiment
* Watch the videos atleast three times 
* Dont stop at lesson 1 and keep continuning and be in the game
* This learning is based on the David perkins
* Learning about the soccer analogy -> type soccer
*   


CODING:
--------
### Data Preparation:
 * How to create a own classifier an your own image data set 
 * pyImageSearch 
 * classify the teddy bear -> diffrent types of them 
 * click on  the particular cell and then directly jump into the mkdir cell
 and do this iteratively.
 * Jeremy is experimentalist, I play aorund and get this into the work
 * Human creativity is best inspired by trying this out and getting into the
results 
* You just know if download from kaggle or academic data set youhave train,vaid and test(WHich I suppose
I miss them)
